What is Big O Notation? Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta. Show 1 Code Example Each Of Linear Time Complexity and Quadratic Time Complexity.

Big O Notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms.

 Big O defines as upper bound and upper bound on an algorithm is the most amount of time required ( the worst case performance). Big Omega defines as lower bound and lower bound on an algorithm is the least amount of time required ( the most efficient way possible, in other words best case). BIg Theta defines as tightest bound and tightest bound is the best of all the worst case times that the algorithm can take.
